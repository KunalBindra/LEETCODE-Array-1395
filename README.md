Certainly! Here's a detailed dry run of the provided `numTeams` method with a sample array of ratings. Let's use the example rating array `[2, 5, 3, 4, 1]`.

**Initial State:**
- `rating = [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]`
- `ans = 0`

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **First Iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - `rating[i] = 5`
   - `leftLess = 0`
   - `leftGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `leftLess` and `leftGreater`:**
     - For `j = 0`: `rating[j] = 2`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `leftLess = 1`
   - `rightLess = 0`
   - `rightGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `rightLess` and `rightGreater`:**
     - For `j = 2`: `rating[j] = 3`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `rightLess = 1`
     - For `j = 3`: `rating[j] = 4`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `rightLess = 2`
     - For `j = 4`: `rating[j] = 1`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `rightLess = 3`
   - `ans += leftLess * rightGreater + leftGreater * rightLess`
   - `ans = 0 + 0 * 3 + 1 * 3 = 3`

2. **Second Iteration (`i = 2`):**
   - `rating[i] = 3`
   - `leftLess = 0`
   - `leftGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `leftLess` and `leftGreater`:**
     - For `j = 0`: `rating[j] = 2`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `leftLess = 1`
     - For `j = 1`: `rating[j] = 5`, which is greater than `rating[i]`, so `leftGreater = 1`
   - `rightLess = 0`
   - `rightGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `rightLess` and `rightGreater`:**
     - For `j = 3`: `rating[j] = 4`, which is greater than `rating[i]`, so `rightGreater = 1`
     - For `j = 4`: `rating[j] = 1`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `rightLess = 1`
   - `ans += leftLess * rightGreater + leftGreater * rightLess`
   - `ans = 3 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 5`

3. **Third Iteration (`i = 3`):**
   - `rating[i] = 4`
   - `leftLess = 0`
   - `leftGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `leftLess` and `leftGreater`:**
     - For `j = 0`: `rating[j] = 2`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `leftLess = 1`
     - For `j = 1`: `rating[j] = 5`, which is greater than `rating[i]`, so `leftGreater = 1`
     - For `j = 2`: `rating[j] = 3`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `leftLess = 2`
   - `rightLess = 0`
   - `rightGreater = 0`
   - **Calculate `rightLess` and `rightGreater`:**
     - For `j = 4`: `rating[j] = 1`, which is less than `rating[i]`, so `rightLess = 1`
   - `ans += leftLess * rightGreater + leftGreater * rightLess`
   - `ans = 5 + 2 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 6`

4. **End of Loop:**
   - The loop terminates as there are no more valid `i` values to consider (`i = rating.length - 1`).

**Final Result:**
- The total number of valid teams is `ans = 6`.

Thus, the method returns `6` for the input array `[2, 5, 3, 4, 1]`.
